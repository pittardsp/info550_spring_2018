# INFO 550 - Software Engineering

## Summary

This course seeks to teach principles of software engineering through hands-on experience in constructing a “real life” 
project. During this course, the student will be exposed to a variety of programming technologies, analysis frameworks, 
and reproducible research tools. We will examine the role of Cloud Computing service models, (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), and 
how they can accelerate the pace of research. Students will acquire hands on exposure and experience with machine 
learning techniques such as clustering ad regression as well as natural language processing techniques. Students will 
use their acquired knowledge to develop a final project application that will address some substantial problem or interest 
 emerging within ‘big data contexts”.
